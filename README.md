# Setup
Follow the instructions below to get your workspace setup:

## CurseForge App (Windows / Mac)
1. Download the [CurseForge App](https://curseforge.overwolf.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already.

2. Fork and clone the repository to the Instances folder of the CurseForge App, the default path is `C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Curseforge\Minecraft\Instances`.

* Note: If you've previously used the Twitch App the path will most likely be `C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Twitch\Minecraft\Instances`.
3. Double click the script InstanceSyncSetup.bat to setup InstanceSync. It is found in the automation folder.

4. Open the CurseForge App and you should see the modpack. If you already had CurseForge App open, restart it.

You're done!
